What is a Dynamic Array?

A Dynamic Array is an array that can automatically grow or shrink in size during runtime.

In normal (static) arrays:

Size is fixed.

You cannot add more elements once it is full.

In dynamic arrays:

Size changes automatically.

When the array becomes full, a new bigger array is created and old elements are copied into it.

Example:

Start with size = 4

Add 5th element → array resizes to size = 8

This is how languages like Python (list), Java (ArrayList), and C++ (vector) work internally.

⚙️ How Dynamic Array Works

Create an initial array with small capacity.

Insert elements normally.

If the array becomes full:

Create a new array with double size.

Copy all old elements to the new array.

Continue inserting.

This resizing takes O(n) time, but since it does not happen often, the average insertion time is O(1) (amortized).

🧠 Operations Supported

Insert element (push)

Delete element (pop / remove)

Access element by index

Resize array automatically

Get current size and capacity

⏱️ Time Complexity
Operation	Time Complexity
Access	O(1)
Insert (avg)	O(1) amortized
Insert (worst – resize)	O(n)
Delete	O(n)
