# 📌 Dynamic Array in Python – Theory Notes

## 1. What is a Dynamic Array?

A **Dynamic Array** is an array that can **automatically resize itself** when elements are added or removed.
Unlike static arrays (fixed size), dynamic arrays **grow and shrink at runtime**.

In Python, the built-in **list** is implemented as a **dynamic array**.

---

## 2. Why Dynamic Arrays Are Needed

In static arrays:

* Size must be declared in advance
* Memory cannot be changed later
* Overflow occurs if size is exceeded

Dynamic arrays solve this by:

* Allocating extra memory
* Resizing automatically when capacity is full

---

## 3. How Dynamic Arrays Work (Resizing Concept)

Dynamic arrays maintain:

* **Size** → number of elements stored
* **Capacity** → total allocated space

When the array becomes full:

1. A **new larger array** is created (usually double the capacity)
2. All existing elements are **copied** to the new array
3. Old array memory is released
4. New element is inserted

This process is called **Resizing / Reallocation**.

---

## 4. Python List as a Dynamic Array

Python `list`:

* Automatically manages memory
* Grows when needed
* Shrinks when many elements are removed

Example:

Start with size = 4

Add 5th element → array resizes to size = 8

This is how languages like Python (list), Java (ArrayList), and C++ (vector) work internally.

⚙️ How Dynamic Array Works

Create an initial array with small capacity.

Insert elements normally.

If the array becomes full:

Create a new array with double size.

Copy all old elements to the new array.

Continue inserting.

This resizing takes O(n) time, but since it does not happen often, the average insertion time is O(1) (amortized).

🧠 Operations Supported

Insert element (push)

Delete element (pop / remove)

Access element by index

Resize array automatically

Get current size and capacity

⏱️ Time Complexity
Operation	Time Complexity
Access	O(1)
Insert (avg)	O(1) amortized
Insert (worst – resize)	O(n)
Delete	O(n)
