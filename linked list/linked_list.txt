# 📌 Linked List in Python – Theory Notes

## 1. What is a Linked List?

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure in which elements (called **nodes**) are stored in a sequence, but unlike arrays, they are **not stored in contiguous memory locations**.

Each node contains:

* **Data** – the value stored
* **Next** – a reference (pointer) to the next node in the list

Because of this, insertion and deletion operations are efficient compared to arrays.

---

## 2. Basic Terminology

* **Node**: A single element of the list containing data and a pointer
* **Head**: The first node of the linked list
* **Tail**: The last node whose `next` pointer is `None`
* **Pointer / Reference**: Stores the address of the next node

---

## 3. Types of Linked Lists

### (a) Singly Linked List

Each node points only to the next node.

```
[Data | Next] → [Data | Next] → [Data | None]
```

Traversal is only in **forward direction**.

---

### (b) Doubly Linked List

Each node has two pointers:

* One to the previous node
* One to the next node

```
None ← [Prev | Data | Next] ↔ [Prev | Data | Next] → None
```

Traversal is possible in **both directions**.

---

### (c) Circular Linked List

The last node points back to the first node (head), forming a circle.

```
[Data | Next] → [Data | Next] → [Data | Next]
        ↑_____________________________________|
```

No node points to `None`.

## 4. Advantages of Linked List

* ✅ Dynamic size (can grow or shrink easily)
* ✅ Efficient insertion and deletion (no shifting needed)
* ✅ Better memory utilization for frequent updates

---

## 5. Disadvantages of Linked List

* ❌ No direct access (no indexing like arrays)
* ❌ Extra memory needed for pointers
* ❌ Slower traversal compared to arrays

---

## 6. Basic Operations on Linked List

### 6.1 Traversal

Visiting each node one by one starting from the head.

### 6.2 Insertion

* At the beginning
* At the end
* At a specific position

### 6.3 Deletion

* From the beginning
* From the end
* From a specific position

### 6.4 Searching

Finding a node with a given value.

## 7. Time Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Access    | O(n)            |
| Search    | O(n)            |
| Insertion | O(1) (at head)  |
| Deletion  | O(1) (at head)  |

## 8. Linked List vs Array

| Feature   | Array        | Linked List    |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Memory    | Contiguous   | Non-contiguous |
| Size      | Fixed        | Dynamic        |
| Access    | O(1) (index) | O(n)           |
| Insertion | Costly       | Efficient      |

## 9. Applications of Linked List

* Implementation of **Stacks and Queues**
* **Dynamic memory management**
* **Undo/Redo operations** in editors
* **Hash tables (chaining)**
* **Polynomial representation**

---

## 10. Conclusion

Linked Lists are powerful data structures when frequent insertion and deletion are required. Although access time is slower than arrays, their dynamic nature makes them very useful in many real-world applications.
